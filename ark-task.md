## Task: Ark UI Integration with shadcn/ui Registry

### Objective
Investigate the current state of integrating **Ark UI** into the **shadcn/ui registry** and identify what work remains to complete the integration.

### Context
Work has already started on adding Ark UI components to the shadcn registry. Some components or configuration may already exist, but the integration is not yet complete.

### Scope of Investigation
- Review existing Ark UI components already added to the shadcn registry
- Identify missing or partially implemented components and primitives
- Check for gaps in:
  - Styling and Tailwind integration
  - Theming and design tokens
  - File structure and naming conventions
  - Exports and registry metadata
- Verify dependency setup, install scripts, and compatibility with shadcn standards

### Deliverables
Produce a concise report that includes:
- Current integration status (what is done vs. incomplete)
- Identified issues or inconsistencies
- A prioritized, actionable checklist of remaining tasks required to complete a production-ready Ark UI → shadcn integration
